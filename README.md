Task 3 Overview: Iris Flower Classification


Objective


The goal of this task was to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. This multi-class classification project served as an introduction to supervised learning, emphasizing data visualization, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation on a clean, benchmark dataset.

Key Activities

•  Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA): Loaded the Iris dataset using scikit-learn, examined structure (head, shape, species distribution), confirmed no missing values, and visualized relationships through pairplots and scatter plots to identify clear separability (especially Setosa).

•  Data Preprocessing: Selected all four measurement features (sepal length/width, petal length/width), applied feature scaling with StandardScaler for better model performance, and split data into training and testing sets (stratified to maintain class balance).

•  Model Building and Training: Implemented a Random Forest Classifier (robust for small datasets), trained on scaled features, and used a train-test split for validation.

•  Model Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy (~95-100%), generated classification report (precision, recall, F1-score per class), visualized confusion matrix, and analyzed feature importances (petal measurements typically most discriminative).

•  Insights and Validation: Interpreted results showing petal features as key differentiators and tested predictions on sample data to demonstrate real-world applicability.


Technologies Used


•  Programming Language: Python

•  Libraries: Pandas (data manipulation), NumPy (numerical operations), Seaborn & Matplotlib (visualization, pairplots, heatmaps), scikit-learn (dataset loading via load_iris, preprocessing with StandardScaler, modeling with RandomForestClassifier, evaluation metrics including accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix)

•  Environment: Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and documentation
